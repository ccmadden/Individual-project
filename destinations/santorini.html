                London is one of my favorite cities. This summer marked the third time I visited, but it never loses its charm. The rich history, diverse cuisine, and overall allure captivate me, and I was thrilled to be back. This page features my experiences at the following:

                    <p class="caption">I arrived in London early in the morning, eager to visit one of my closest high school friends, Marina. She had been studying abroad at the London School of Economics over the summer, and since Iâ€™d spent much of my own summer away, I hadnâ€™t had many chances to reconnect with friends from home. It was wonderful to finally catch up and spend time together. And what better way to do it than over afternoon tea? We spent the day sipping tea and chatting, sharing stories of our recent experiences. It was a perfect day in every way.</p>
